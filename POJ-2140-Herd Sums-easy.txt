 *Case1:
 *If the length of sequence is odd, we suppose it (2d-1), the avegrage x
 *then we have (2d-1)x = n
 *Case2:
 *If the length of sequence is even, we suppose the middle two numbers' sum is(2b-1)
 *and the pair of number is y(suppose x and x-1, x+1 and x-2 is a pair)
 *then we have (2b-1)y = n
 *After all, the answer is converted to "how many odd factor does n have?"
